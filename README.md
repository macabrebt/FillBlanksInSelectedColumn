# FillBlanksInSelectedColumn
Excel VBA Macro to Fill Blank Cells

This macro and readme was generated by Google Gemini. The code has been test on Microsoft excel 2019. 

The macro fills blank cells in the currently selected column with the value from the non-blank cell directly above it.
To use the Excel VBA script, follow these steps:

How to Use the VBA Script:

Open VBA Editor: In Excel, press Alt + F11 on your keyboard. This will open the Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications window.

Insert a Module: In the VBA editor, go to the menu bar and click on Insert > Module. A new, blank module window will appear.

Paste the Code: Copy the entire VBA code from the Canvas (the code starting with Sub FillBlanksInSelectedColumn() and ending with End Sub) and paste it into the newly opened module window.

Return to Excel: Close the VBA editor window or minimize it to go back to your Excel worksheet.

Select the Column: In your Excel spreadsheet, select the column (or a specific range within a column) where you want to fill the blank cells. You can click on the column letter at the top (e.g., 'A', 'B') to select the entire column, or drag your mouse to select a specific range of cells.

Run the Macro: Press Alt + F8 on your keyboard. This will open the "Macro" dialog box. From the list of macros, select FillBlanksInSelectedColumn. Click the Run button.

Once you run the macro, it will automatically fill the blank cells in your selected column with the value from the last non-blank cell above them. A message box will pop up to confirm that the macro has completed its task.
